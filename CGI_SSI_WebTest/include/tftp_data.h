static const char Testdata[] = "The ESP8266EX offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi SoC solution. "
"With low power consumption, a compact design and high stability, it caters to the needs of its users.\r\n"
"It can be used to host applications or to offload Wi-Fi network functions from other"
"application processors. When the ESP8266 hosts an application, as the only processor in"
"the device, it boots up directly from an external flash. It has an built-in, high-speed cache"
"which improves the performance of the system and optimizes the memory. Alternatively,"
"when the ESP8266EX is used as a Wi-Fi adapter, wireless internet access can be added to"
"any microcontroller-based device through the SPI/SDIO interface or the I2C/UART"
"interface, and thus provide the users with a simple Wi-Fi solution.\r\n"
"Furthermore, the ESP8266EX offers a high level of on-chip integration. It integrates the"
"antenna switch, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power"
"management modules. It requires minimal external circuitry, and the entire solution,"
"including the front-end module, is designed to occupy minimal PCB space.\r\n"
"The ESP8266EX also integrates an enhanced version of the 32-bit processor of Tensilicaâ€™s"
"L106 Diamond series, with on-chip SRAM. The ESP8266EX is often integrated with"
"external sensors and other application-specific devices through its GPIOs. The SDK files"
"provide examples of the software of the related applications.";
